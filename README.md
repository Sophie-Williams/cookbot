# CookBot

Cookbot is a playing bot for the CookServeDelicious game. It's written in Python and C and works the Linux version of the game.


## Features

CookBot can run in full-auto mode, accepting and delivering orders, or in semi-auto mode, where the bot only crafts recipes and the player can use the 1-8 keys for accepting and delivering orders.


## Limitations

- The auto-order mode is far from perfect and may produce average or bad orders if you have too many active recipes which require cooking. It should work very well if all active recipes are finished instantly and don't have a cooking period.




## Installing
